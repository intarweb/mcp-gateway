//! Destructive-tool confirmation prompt.
//!
//! **This is a courtesy, not a security control.** It asks the connected client
//! to confirm with the human before a destructive meta-tool runs, and it
//! proceeds when the client cannot ask — see the outcome table below. A caller
//! that wants to skip it simply declares no elicitation capability, so it stops
//! nobody who is trying to get past it.
//!
//! What actually restricts these tools is the admin requirement: every tool this
//! covers is in the admin set, so a caller without a credential cannot reach one
//! at all. That is the control; this is the confirmation an honest client offers
//! its user.
//!
//! It is documented this way deliberately. An earlier version of this header
//! cited OWASP ASI09, which reads as a control and invites over-trust in a
//! prompt that waves things through.
//!
//! Before executing any meta-tool annotated with `destructiveHint: true`, the
//! gateway sends an `elicitation/create` request to the connected MCP client so
//! the human operator can confirm or decline the action.
//!
//! # Protocol behaviour
//!
//! - **Elicitation supported**: the client receives an `elicitation/create`
//!   message; the call is aborted unless the client responds `"accept"`.
//! - **Elicitation not supported / no session**: the two eras answer
//!   differently, and this fork is what the rest of the module turns on. A
//!   **modern** request is REFUSED: the caller carries
//!   [`ConfirmationPolicy::for_modern`], which is [`ConfirmationPolicy::REFUSE`],
//!   and the gate returns JSON-RPC `-32001` without running the tool. A
//!   **legacy** request PROCEEDS after a `WARN` log entry
//!   ([`ConfirmationPolicy::for_legacy`]), unchanged — a 2025 client that never
//!   declared elicitation has been served that way for the life of the gateway,
//!   and that matches the MCP spec guidance that servers MUST NOT break when a
//!   client omits optional capabilities. Which era a request belongs to is
//!   decided at the edge that can see it, not here.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! match require_destructive_confirmation(&proxy, session_id, "kill server 'payments'").await {
//!     ConfirmationOutcome::Confirmed => { /* execute */ }
//!     ConfirmationOutcome::Declined  => return /* abort, surface denial */ ,
//!     // Nobody could be asked. Refuse or proceed is the CALLER's decision,
//!     // taken from the era's ConfirmationPolicy; the WARN is logged either way.
//!     ConfirmationOutcome::Unsupported => { /* consult ConfirmationPolicy */ }
//! }
//! ```
